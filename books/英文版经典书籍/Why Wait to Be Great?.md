Fake it till you make it. c:28

affirmations c:11

the only time success comes before work is in the dictionary! c:21

If we are to fake it till we make it, we need to fake the positive behaviors, thoughts, and feelings that are opposite to the negative ones we’re currently experiencing. c:16

We think we need to have the feeling first, in order to do the behavior, but we don’t. It’s usually the opposite. If we just make the decision, do the behavior, and fake the feeling for a while, more often than not we will actually start feeling it for real!” c:16

More often than not, our feelings will eventually catch up with our behaviors. So instead of waiting for the feeling to arrive, why not behave that way first and pretend to feel it too? You’ll soon find that you actually do start feeling that way. Instead of being stuck, you start moving. c:16

Doing is the bridge to being — going from conscious to unconscious. c:21

## 远大前程（英文版）

狄更斯  -  

> 是英国19世纪著名作家查尔斯·狄更斯的后期作品，也是他思想上最为成熟的作品之一，与他所写的其他涉及孤儿题材的小说一样，书中以充满同情和细致入微的笔触塑造了乔、匹普和毕蒂等朴实善良的小人物，但不同的是，作家那时对社会和人生有了更深刻的体验，以往贯穿于作品中的幽默讥讽风格逐渐淡化，在这部小说里呈现出狄更斯更趋成熟的人生观。

Once for all; I loved her none the less because I knew it, and it had no more influence in restraining me than if I had devoutly believed her to be human perfection. c:20

what real love is. It is blind devotion, unquestioning self-humiliation, utter submission, trust and belief against yourself and against the whole world, giving up your whole heart and soul to the smiter—as I did!" c:13

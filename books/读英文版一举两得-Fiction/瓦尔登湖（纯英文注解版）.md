## 瓦尔登湖（纯英文注解版）

亨利·梭罗著 朱伟 许乃夫主编  -  教育学习榜-外语

> 《瓦尔登湖》是美国作家、诗人和哲学家亨利·戴维·梭罗的传世名著，记述了梭罗本人在瓦尔登湖畔两年又两月的隐逸生活。书中详细记录了作家在长达两年的时间里的日常生活状态以及所思所想，他在小木屋旁开荒种地，春种秋收，自给自足。他是自然之子，崇尚自然，与自然交朋友，与湖水、森林和飞鸟对话；白天，他在林中观察动物和植物，在船上吹笛，在湖边钓鱼；晚上，他在小木屋中记下自己的观察和思考。他追求精神生活，关注灵魂的成长，他骄傲地宣称：“每个人都是自己王国的国王，与这个王国相比，沙皇帝国也不过是一个卑微小国，犹如冰天雪地中的小雪团。”梭罗以他的实际行动告诉我们：人们所追求的大部分奢侈品，大部分的所谓生活的舒适，非但没有必要，而且对人类进步大有妨碍。

### 序言

“塑造人类文明的25部作品之一”的《瓦尔登湖》是那么让人宁静致远，心驰神往。 c:74

少一些功利主义的追求，多一些不为什么的坚持 c:370

让我们在城市的喧嚣中保持一颗安静而炙热的心，倾听这位先哲给我们留下来的巨大精神财富。 c:49

在两年零两个月的孤独生活中，大自然成了他的叙述对象，大至四季交替的景色变化，小到两只蚂蚁的争斗。梭罗带你观察大自然的美，带给你一颗宁静的心，也给了你一片蔚蓝的湖，因为梭罗对自然的寻觅在于回归自身的灵性。 c:163

清醒得足以从事体力劳动的人数以百万计，但百万人中只有一个清醒得足以从事脑力劳动，而清醒得足以过上诗意或者神圣生活的人，一亿人中才有一人。唯有清醒才是真正的活着。 c:503

博物学是人类和大自然打交道的学问，指对动物、植物、矿物、生态系统等所做出的宏观层面的观察、描述、分类等。 c:108

虽然他在文章中也提到不提倡大家像他一样生活，但是他却做出了榜样，身体力行地去实践他自己认为正确的生活方式，告诉人们不要随波逐流，放任自我，而要听从内心的呼唤，找到真实的自我。 c:259

超验主义是让美国文学进入到浪漫主义时期的文学时代。1837年8月31日，拉尔夫·沃尔多·爱默生发表了著名的演讲——《美国学者》，他批判了当时美国知识分子唯欧洲是从的倾向。这次演讲极为成功，也引起了极大的反响，被认为是“美国知识界的独立宣言”。 c:67

梭罗其实并不反对新生的社会现象，他所担忧的是社会进步只带给人们客观条件的改善，而不能促进思想境界的提升。 c:180

这段话极具讽刺意味：不知道是人们改变的物质生活，还是铁路把人们改变了。 c:62

《瓦尔登湖》这本书体现出了最美国式的风格：个人主义。个人主义（individualism）是相对于集体主义（collectivism）而言。 c:109

每个人都能够清醒地活着，追随内心真实感受和想法 c:356

night.Little is to be expected of that day, if it can be called a day, to which we are not awakened by our Genius, but by the mechanical nudging of some servitor, are not awakened by our own newly acquired force and aspirations from within, and a fragrance filling the air—to a higher life than we fell asleep from[插图]; c:45

All intelligences awake with the morning. c:22

Morning is when I am awake and there is a dawn in me. c:11

The millions are awake enough for physical labor;but only one in a million is awake enough for effective intellectual exertion,only one in a hundred millions to a poetic or divine life.To be awake is to be alive. c:51

To affect the quality of the day, that is the highest of arts. c:25

I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only theessential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, andnot, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. c:70

### Reading

Being seated, to run through the region of the spiritual world; I have had this advantage in books. To be intoxicated by a single glass of wine; I have experienced this pleasure when I have drunk the liquor of the esoteric[插图] doctrines.” c:28

To read well, that is, to read true books in a true spirit, is a noble exercise, and one that will task the reader more than any exercise which the customs of the day esteem. c:36

Not till we are lost, in other words not till we have lost the world, do we begin to find ourselves, and realize where we are and the infinite extent of our relations. c:18

### The Ponds

A lake is the landscape's most beautiful and expressive feature.It is earth's eye; looking into which the beholder measures the depth of his own nature.The fluviatile[插图] trees next the shore are the slender eyelashes which fringe it, and the wooded hills and cliffs around are its overhanging brows. c:19

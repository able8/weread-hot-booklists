## 汤姆叔叔的小屋（英文版）

> 《汤姆叔叔的小屋》，19世纪极具影响力的小说（其销量仅次于《圣经》），并被认为是刺激1850年废奴主义兴起的一大因素。在其发表的头一年里，仅美国本土便销售出了三十多万册，这在19世纪中叶可是天文数字。《汤姆叔叔的小屋》对美国社会的影响如此巨大，以致在南北战争爆发的初期，当林肯接见斯托夫人时，曾说到：“你就是那位引发了一场大战的小妇人。”后来，这句话为众多作家竞相引用。

So long as the law considers all these human beings, with beating hearts and living affections, only as so many things belonging to a master, —so long as the failure, or misfortune, or imprudence, or death of the kindest owner, may cause them any day to exchange a life of kind protection and indulgence for one of hopeless misery and toil, —so long it is impossible to make anything beautiful or desirable in the best regulated administration of slavery. c:14

## 月亮与六便士（英文版）

毛姆  -  

> 1919年，毛姆45岁时，发表了这部《月亮与六便士》。小说故事情节相对比较简单：某进入中年的英国券商，忽然决定抛妻弃子，跟随内心长久以来积压着的念头，立志要成为一个艺术家。这个故事的源头来自画家高更的生平故事。这种行为并不为世俗社会所认可。本来作为一个券商，手里有大把大把的钞票可以挥霍过活，为什么非要当什么艺术家？为什么最后连生存都变成一个问题？结果，这位想成为艺术家的券商后来连个住处都找不到，身体也患上了疾病，混到了没有钱买食物果腹，整天挨饿的境地。也许，艺术家的世界，凡夫俗子们永远不会懂。这位艺术家不仅没有被这种境地吓倒，反而愈加坚强地活了下去。而且，不顾身体上的疾病带来的不适，也无视周遭环境的恶劣程度，一心扑在绘画的创作之中。在太平洋的一个叫作塔西提的小岛上，他创作出了让人看一眼就会产生荡气回肠感觉的“杰作”。但此时，他已经溘然长逝。那么，为什么叫“月亮与六便士”？其实，用毛姆自己的话说，这个书名的意义并没有在书里得到应有的展示，而是出自某评论家在评论上述《人性的枷锁》时所写的某句话。原话如下：《人性的枷锁》里的主人公菲利普·凯利（PhilipCarey）被形容为一个太过执着找寻月亮的家伙，以至于他从来没发现过脚底下就有一块六便士。毛姆后来这样解释道：“假如你低头在地上不住地要找寻一块六便士硬币，头也不抬起来一下，那么，你就会丢掉月亮。”

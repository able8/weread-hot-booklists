Robinson Crusoe is the story of a man who was shipwrecked for almost 30 years on a tropical island. The novel recounts Robinson’s struggle to survive alone as well as his adventures among cannibals and with his friend and servant Friday.Robinson Crusoe was very popular in 1719, with six editions printed in the first four months.

It has been adapted into comic books, children’s books, plays, pantomimes and films.Since publication, countless copies of Robinson Crusoe have been sold and it has been translated into many languages.

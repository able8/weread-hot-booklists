Published after Charlotte Bronte's death in 1855. The book is the story of a young man, William Crimsworth, and is a first-person narrative from his perspective. It describes his maturation, his career as a teacher in Brussels, and his personal relationships. William, orphaned at a young age, rejects the life of a clergyman his uncles choose for him and sets out on his own, eventually becoming a teacher at an all-girls school in Belgium. Once established there, he finds himself falling for a talented student, Frances, but their budding romance is threatened by petty jealousies. The final novel published by any of the famous Bronte sisters, The Professor was based partly on Charlotte's own experiences teaching in Belgium where she studied as a language student in 1842.","lastChapterIdx":9,"paperBook":{"skuId":""},"chapterSize":9,"updateTime":1581649243,"onTime":1551162095,"unitPrice":0.05,"marketType":0,"isbn":"","publisher":"北京明天远航文化传播有限公司","publishTime":"2019-08-01 00:00:00","totalWords":22997,"publishPrice":26.97,"recommended":0,"lectureRecommended":0,"follow":0,"secret":0,"offline":0,"lectureOffline":0,"finishReading":0,"isAutoPay":0,"availables":0,"paid":0,"isChapterPaid":0,"showLectureButton":1,"wxtts":1,"ratingCount":0,"ratingDetail":{"one":0,"two":0,"three":0,"four":0,"five":0,"recent":0},"newRating":0,"newRatingCount":0,"newRatingDetail":{"good":0,"fair":0,"poor":0,"recent":0,"myRating":"","title":"待评分"},"copyrightInfo":{"id":2521053,"name":"明天远航","userVid":0},"authorSeg":[{"words":"Charlotte Bronte","highlight":1}]}

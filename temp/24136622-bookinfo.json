Whilst his betrayal of family, duty and honour gives him the freedom to achieve greatness, his decision leads to an obsession which carries severe implications. Inspired by the life of Paul Gauguin, The Moon and Sixpence is at once a satiric caricature of Edwardian conventions and a vivid portrayal of the mentality of a genius.","lastChapterIdx":10,"paperBook":{"skuId":""},"chapterSize":10,"updateTime":1581653776,"onTime":1551164087,"unitPrice":0.05,"marketType":0,"isbn":"","publisher":"北京明天远航文化传播有限公司","publishTime":"2019-03-01 00:00:00","totalWords":10136,"publishPrice":26.97,"recommended":0,"lectureRecommended":0,"follow":0,"secret":0,"offline":0,"lectureOffline":0,"finishReading":0,"isAutoPay":0,"availables":0,"paid":0,"isChapterPaid":0,"showLectureButton":1,"wxtts":1,"star":82,"ratingCount":128,"ratingDetail":{"one":5,"two":1,"three":10,"four":24,"five":88,"recent":1},"newRating":778,"newRatingCount":117,"newRatingDetail":{"good":91,"fair":22,"poor":4,"recent":1,"myRating":"","title":""},"copyrightInfo":{"id":2521053,"name":"明天远航","userVid":0},"authorSeg":[{"words":"W.

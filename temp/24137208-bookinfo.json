The first-person narrative is told from the point of view of him, he is living in a suite at a German hotel. The patriarch of the family, The General, is indebted to the Frenchman de Griers and has mortgaged his property in Russia to pay only a small amount of his debt. Upon learning of the illness of his wealthy aunt, \"Grandmother\", he sends streams of telegrams to Moscow and awaits the news of her demise. His expected inheritance will pay his debts and gain Mademoiselle Blanche de Cominges's hand in marriage. It is a stunning psychological portrait of a young man's exhilarating and destructive addiction, a compulsion that Dostoevsky–who once gambled away his young wife's wedding ring–knew intimately from his own experience. In the disastrous love affairs and gambling adventures of his character, Alexei Ivanovich, Dostoevsky explores the irresistible temptation to look into the abyss of ultimate risk that he believed was an essential part of the Russian national character. Dostoevsky completed the novel under a strict deadline to pay off gambling debts.","lastChapterIdx":5,"paperBook":{"skuId":""},"chapterSize":5,"updateTime":1581653780,"onTime":1551161975,"unitPrice":0.05,"marketType":0,"isbn":"","publisher":"北京明天远航文化传播有限公司","publishTime":"2019-12-01 00:00:00","totalWords":13991,"publishPrice":26.97,"recommended":0,"lectureRecommended":0,"follow":0,"secret":0,"offline":0,"lectureOffline":0,"finishReading":0,"isAutoPay":0,"availables":0,"paid":0,"isChapterPaid":0,"showLectureButton":1,"wxtts":1,"ratingCount":1,"ratingDetail":{"one":0,"two":0,"three":0,"four":0,"five":1,"recent":0},"newRating":0,"newRatingCount":1,"newRatingDetail":{"good":1,"fair":0,"poor":0,"recent":0,"myRating":"","title":"评分不足"},"copyrightInfo":{"id":2521053,"name":"明天远航","userVid":0},"authorSeg":[{"words":"Fyodor Dostoyevsky","highlight":1}]}

His guilt at the central role he played in her ruin soon leads him on a quest for forgiveness as he follows her into the prisons of Siberia.","lastChapterIdx":42,"paperBook":{"skuId":""},"chapterSize":42,"updateTime":1581653779,"onTime":1550474303,"unitPrice":0.05,"marketType":0,"isbn":"","publisher":"北京明天远航文化传播有限公司","publishTime":"2019-03-01 00:00:00","totalWords":65127,"publishPrice":26.97,"recommended":0,"lectureRecommended":0,"follow":0,"secret":0,"offline":0,"lectureOffline":0,"finishReading":0,"isAutoPay":0,"availables":0,"paid":0,"isChapterPaid":0,"showLectureButton":1,"wxtts":1,"ratingCount":7,"ratingDetail":{"one":0,"two":0,"three":0,"four":0,"five":7,"recent":0},"newRating":0,"newRatingCount":7,"newRatingDetail":{"good":7,"fair":0,"poor":0,"recent":0,"myRating":"","title":"评分不足"},"copyrightInfo":{"id":2521053,"name":"明天远航","userVid":0},"authorSeg":[{"words":"Leo Tolstoy","highlight":1}]}

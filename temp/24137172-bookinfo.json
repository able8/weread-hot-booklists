H. Lawrence (11 September 1885 – 2 March 1930), an English writer and poet. which were originally written between 1913 and 1921, many of them against the background of World War I. Most of these versions were placed in magazines or periodicals.  The first UK edition was published by Martin Secker in 1924. Normally, volumes of short stories frequently share the title of one of the tales in the collection. Often the first story is dignified in this way, and often that's because it announces a theme or topic that runs throughout the volume. In the \"England and Other Stories,\" the title story is \"England, My England\". The stories included in the collection are: England, My England; Tickets, Please; The Blind Man; Monkey Nuts; Wintry Peacock; You Touched Me; Samson and Delilah; The Primrose Path; The Horse Dealer's Daughter; Fanny And Annie.","lastChapterIdx":3,"paperBook":{"skuId":""},"chapterSize":3,"updateTime":1581649769,"onTime":1550816293,"unitPrice":0.05,"marketType":0,"isbn":"","publisher":"北京明天远航文化传播有限公司","publishTime":"2019-12-01 00:00:00","totalWords":17053,"publishPrice":26.97,"recommended":0,"lectureRecommended":0,"follow":0,"secret":0,"offline":0,"lectureOffline":0,"finishReading":0,"isAutoPay":0,"availables":0,"paid":0,"isChapterPaid":0,"showLectureButton":1,"wxtts":1,"ratingCount":8,"ratingDetail":{"one":1,"two":0,"three":2,"four":0,"five":5,"recent":0},"newRating":0,"newRatingCount":8,"newRatingDetail":{"good":5,"fair":2,"poor":1,"recent":0,"myRating":"","title":"评分不足"},"copyrightInfo":{"id":2521053,"name":"明天远航","userVid":0},"authorSeg":[{"words":"D.H.

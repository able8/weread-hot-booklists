Water Village creates a utopia—the kind of classic village scene that was often evoked in Classical Chinese pastoral poetry. In this utopia live two lifelong friends—the wise and beautiful Grandma Hui, as generous as she is kind; and her close friend, the fair and tough Grandpa Yu, upstanding pillar of local society. The friendship and intimacy they share run deep, but their hearts are pure—they would never cross the forbidden line between men and women.This is a book composed from the author’s profound insight into the history of rural life and the epochal changes it has undergone.","lastChapterIdx":8,"paperBook":{"skuId":""},"chapterSize":8,"updateTime":1615945600,"onTime":1578279122,"unitPrice":0.05,"marketType":0,"isbn":"9781908647627","publisher":"中译出版社","publishTime":"2019-08-01 00:00:00","totalWords":583915,"publishPrice":160.00,"bookSize":935814,"recommended":0,"lectureRecommended":0,"follow":0,"secret":0,"offline":0,"lectureOffline":0,"finishReading":0,"isAutoPay":0,"availables":0,"paid":0,"isChapterPaid":0,"showLectureButton":1,"wxtts":1,"ratingCount":0,"ratingDetail":{"one":0,"two":0,"three":0,"four":0,"five":0,"recent":0},"newRating":0,"newRatingCount":0,"newRatingDetail":{"good":0,"fair":0,"poor":0,"recent":0,"myRating":"","title":"待评分"},"copyrightInfo":{"id":2000000723,"name":"北京欣博友数据","userVid":0},"authorSeg":[{"words":"Wang Yuewen","highlight":1}]}

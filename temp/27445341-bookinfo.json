Then she receives a mysterious phone call summoning her thousands of miles south, and her life is upended once again. Who is this man claiming to be her long-lost brother? Will she ever be reunited with her daughter? And with enough distance, can she finally escape the shadow of her own traumatic childhood?In this tumultuous, semi-autobiographical family saga, set against the dramatic backdrop of twentieth-century China, acclaimed Uyghur author Patigül leads a reader back through five generations of Fatimah’s family, revealing the upheavals and tragedies that have shaped it. Ingeniously weaving together religious commentary, fairy tales and folk legends, Bloodline is a searing insight into what it means to feel like you belong, exploring the blood that binds and the wounds that stay behind.","lastChapterIdx":49,"paperBook":{"skuId":""},"chapterSize":49,"updateTime":1615910217,"onTime":1578033642,"unitPrice":0.05,"marketType":0,"isbn":"9781908647696","publisher":"中译出版社","publishTime":"2019-08-01 00:00:00","totalWords":393256,"publishPrice":160.00,"bookSize":776008,"recommended":0,"lectureRecommended":0,"follow":0,"secret":0,"offline":0,"lectureOffline":0,"finishReading":0,"isAutoPay":0,"availables":0,"paid":0,"isChapterPaid":0,"showLectureButton":1,"wxtts":1,"ratingCount":2,"ratingDetail":{"one":0,"two":0,"three":0,"four":1,"five":1,"recent":0},"newRating":0,"newRatingCount":2,"newRatingDetail":{"good":2,"fair":0,"poor":0,"recent":0,"myRating":"","title":"评分不足"},"copyrightInfo":{"id":2000000723,"name":"北京欣博友数据","userVid":0},"authorSeg":[{"words":"PATIGÜL","highlight":1}]}

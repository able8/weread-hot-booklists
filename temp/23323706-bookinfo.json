Eventually, however, after saving the life of the king, the modest nightingale chooses to return to her peaceful life in the forest. Though the emperor banishes the nightingale in preference of a jeweled mechanical imitation, the little bird remains faithful and returns years later when the emperor is near death and no one else can help him as only the song of the true nightingale can heal him. Beautifully illustrated, this classic tale will capture children's interest and spark their imagination inspiring a lifelong love of literature and reading.","lastChapterIdx":37,"paperBook":{"skuId":""},"chapterSize":37,"updateTime":1618406810,"onTime":1545016473,"unitPrice":0.05,"marketType":0,"isbn":"9781620280430","publisher":"Trajectory, Inc.","publishTime":"2013-07-11 00:00:00","totalWords":721,"publishPrice":8.00,"bookSize":293583,"recommended":0,"lectureRecommended":0,"follow":0,"secret":0,"offline":0,"lectureOffline":0,"finishReading":0,"isAutoPay":0,"availables":0,"paid":0,"isChapterPaid":0,"showLectureButton":1,"wxtts":1,"star":79,"ratingCount":51,"ratingDetail":{"one":2,"two":0,"three":8,"four":14,"five":27,"recent":0},"newRating":667,"newRatingCount":48,"newRatingDetail":{"good":32,"fair":14,"poor":2,"recent":0,"myRating":"","title":""},"copyrightInfo":{"id":2000001037,"name":"中国科技资料","userVid":0},"authorSeg":[{"words":"Hans Christian Andersen","highlight":1}]}

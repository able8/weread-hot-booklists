It would seem that they could take up the threads of their lives in peace. As fate would have it though, the pair are summoned to the Old Bailey to testify against a young Frenchman — Charles Darnay — falsely accused of treason. Strangely enough, Darnay bears an uncanny resemblance to another man in the courtroom, the dissolute lawyer's clerk Sydney Carton. It is a coincidence that saves Darnay from certain doom more than once.","lastChapterIdx":15,"paperBook":{"skuId":""},"chapterSize":15,"updateTime":1581655010,"onTime":1550474601,"unitPrice":0.05,"marketType":0,"isbn":"","publisher":"北京明天远航文化传播有限公司","publishTime":"2019-03-01 00:00:00","totalWords":48331,"publishPrice":26.97,"recommended":0,"lectureRecommended":0,"follow":0,"secret":0,"offline":0,"lectureOffline":0,"finishReading":0,"isAutoPay":0,"availables":0,"paid":0,"isChapterPaid":0,"showLectureButton":1,"wxtts":1,"ratingCount":12,"ratingDetail":{"one":1,"two":0,"three":1,"four":1,"five":9,"recent":0},"newRating":0,"newRatingCount":10,"newRatingDetail":{"good":8,"fair":2,"poor":0,"recent":0,"myRating":"","title":"评分不足"},"copyrightInfo":{"id":2521053,"name":"明天远航","userVid":0},"authorSeg":[{"words":"Charles Dickens","highlight":1}]}

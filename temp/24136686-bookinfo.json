It is regarded, along with Anna Karenina, as Tolstoy's finest literary achievement. It is a vast epic centred on Napoleon's war with Russia. Tolstoy's genius is seen clearly in the multitude of characters in this massive chronicle—all of them fully realized and equally memorable.While it expresses Tolstoy's view that history is an inexorable process which man cannot influence, he peoples his great novel with a cast of over five hundred characters. Epic in scale, War and Peace delineates in graphic detail events leading up to Napoleon's invasion of Russia, and the impact of the Napoleonic era on Tsarist society, as seen through the eyes of five Russian aristocratic families.","lastChapterIdx":87,"paperBook":{"skuId":""},"chapterSize":87,"updateTime":1581653779,"onTime":1550454766,"unitPrice":0.05,"marketType":0,"isbn":"","publisher":"北京明天远航文化传播有限公司","publishTime":"2019-04-01 00:00:00","totalWords":107092,"publishPrice":26.97,"recommended":0,"lectureRecommended":0,"follow":0,"secret":0,"offline":0,"lectureOffline":0,"finishReading":0,"isAutoPay":0,"availables":0,"paid":0,"isChapterPaid":0,"showLectureButton":1,"wxtts":1,"ratingCount":8,"ratingDetail":{"one":0,"two":0,"three":1,"four":1,"five":6,"recent":1},"newRating":0,"newRatingCount":8,"newRatingDetail":{"good":6,"fair":2,"poor":0,"recent":1,"myRating":"","title":"评分不足"},"copyrightInfo":{"id":2521053,"name":"明天远航","userVid":0},"authorSeg":[{"words":"Leo Tolstoy","highlight":1}]}

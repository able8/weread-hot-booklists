With Wives and Daughters (1865) and Cranford (1853), it is one of her best-known novels. The later version renewed interest in the novel and attracted a wider readership. One of literature's greatest romances, North and South is both an incisive social commentary and an electric portrayal of all-conquering love. The book tries to show the industrial North and its conflicts in the mid-19th century as seen by an outsider, a socially sensitive lady from the South. The heroine of the story, Margaret Hale, is the daughter of a Nonconformist minister who moves to the fictional industrial town of Milton after leaving the Church of England. The town is modeled after Manchester, where Gaskell lived as the wife of a Unitarian minister. Gaskell herself worked among the poor and knew at first hand the misery of the industrial areas.","lastChapterIdx":10,"paperBook":{"skuId":""},"chapterSize":10,"updateTime":1581649742,"onTime":1551146699,"unitPrice":0.05,"marketType":0,"isbn":"","publisher":"北京明天远航文化传播有限公司","publishTime":"2020-01-01 00:00:00","totalWords":34196,"publishPrice":26.97,"recommended":0,"lectureRecommended":0,"follow":0,"secret":0,"offline":0,"lectureOffline":0,"finishReading":0,"isAutoPay":0,"availables":0,"paid":0,"isChapterPaid":0,"showLectureButton":1,"wxtts":1,"ratingCount":4,"ratingDetail":{"one":0,"two":0,"three":0,"four":0,"five":4,"recent":0},"newRating":0,"newRatingCount":4,"newRatingDetail":{"good":4,"fair":0,"poor":0,"recent":0,"myRating":"","title":"评分不足"},"copyrightInfo":{"id":2521053,"name":"明天远航","userVid":0},"authorSeg":[{"words":"E.C.

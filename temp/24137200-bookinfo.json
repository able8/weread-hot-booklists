Inspired by the works of Gogol, Pushkin, and Karamzin, as well as English and French authors, Poor Folk is written in the form of letters between the two main characters, Makar Devushkin and Varvara Dobroselova, who are poor second cousins. The novel showcases the life of poor people, their relationship with rich people, and poverty in general, all common themes of literary naturalism. A deep but odd friendship develops between them until Dobroselova loses her interest in literature, and later in communicating with Devushkin after a rich widower Mr. Bykov proposes to her. While Vissarion Belinsky dubbed the novel Russia's first \"social novel\" and Alexander Herzen called it a major socialist work, other critics detected parody and satire.","lastChapterIdx":13,"paperBook":{"skuId":""},"chapterSize":13,"updateTime":1581653780,"onTime":1551150121,"unitPrice":0.05,"marketType":0,"isbn":"","publisher":"北京明天远航文化传播有限公司","publishTime":"2019-12-01 00:00:00","totalWords":15202,"publishPrice":26.97,"recommended":0,"lectureRecommended":0,"follow":0,"secret":0,"offline":0,"lectureOffline":0,"finishReading":0,"isAutoPay":0,"availables":0,"paid":0,"isChapterPaid":0,"showLectureButton":1,"wxtts":1,"ratingCount":2,"ratingDetail":{"one":0,"two":0,"three":0,"four":0,"five":2,"recent":0},"newRating":0,"newRatingCount":1,"newRatingDetail":{"good":1,"fair":0,"poor":0,"recent":0,"myRating":"","title":"评分不足"},"copyrightInfo":{"id":2521053,"name":"明天远航","userVid":0},"authorSeg":[{"words":"Fyodor Dostoyevsky","highlight":1}]}

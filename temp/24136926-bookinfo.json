First published in January 1845, the poem is often noted for its musicality, stylized language, and supernatural atmosphere. It tells of a talking raven's mysterious visit to a distraught lover, tracing the man's slow fall into madness. The lover, often identified as being a student, is lamenting the loss of his love, Lenore. Sitting on a bust of Pallas, the raven seems to further distress the protagonist with its constant repetition of the word \"Nevermore\". The poem makes use of folk, mythological, religious, and classical references. Poe claimed to have written the poem logically and methodically, intending to create a poem that would appeal to both critical and popular tastes, as he explained in his 1846 follow-up essay, \"The Philosophy of Composition\". The poem was inspired in part by a talking raven in the novel Barnaby Rudge: A Tale of the Riots of 'Eighty by Charles Dickens. Poe borrows the complex rhythm and meter of Elizabeth Barrett's poem \"Lady Geraldine's Courtship\", and makes use of internal rhyme as well as alliteration throughout.","lastChapterIdx":3,"paperBook":{"skuId":""},"chapterSize":3,"updateTime":1581649784,"onTime":1551058096,"unitPrice":0.05,"marketType":0,"isbn":"","publisher":"北京明天远航文化传播有限公司","publishTime":"2019-08-01 00:00:00","totalWords":1126,"publishPrice":26.97,"recommended":0,"lectureRecommended":0,"follow":0,"secret":0,"offline":0,"lectureOffline":0,"finishReading":0,"isAutoPay":0,"availables":0,"paid":0,"isChapterPaid":0,"showLectureButton":1,"wxtts":1,"star":83,"ratingCount":114,"ratingDetail":{"one":0,"two":1,"three":9,"four":29,"five":75,"recent":1},"newRating":787,"newRatingCount":108,"newRatingDetail":{"good":85,"fair":23,"poor":0,"recent":1,"myRating":"","title":""},"copyrightInfo":{"id":2521053,"name":"明天远航","userVid":0},"authorSeg":[{"words":"Allan Poe","highlight":1}]}

The story follows the \"happy and dauntless and sagacious\" Prince Prospero's attempts to avoid a dangerous plague known as the Red Death by hiding in his castellated abbey. He, along with many other wealthy nobles, has a masquerade ball within seven rooms of his abbey, each decorated with a different color. In the midst of their revelry, a mysterious figure enters and makes his way through each of the rooms. When Prospero confronts this stranger, he falls dead. The story follows many traditions of Gothic fiction and is often analyzed as an allegory about the inevitability of death, though some critics advise against an allegorical reading. Many different interpretations have been presented, as well as attempts to identify the true nature of the disease of the \"Red Death.\"","lastChapterIdx":4,"paperBook":{"skuId":""},"chapterSize":4,"updateTime":1581649783,"onTime":1551083044,"unitPrice":0.05,"marketType":0,"isbn":"","publisher":"北京明天远航文化传播有限公司","publishTime":"2019-08-01 00:00:00","totalWords":2437,"publishPrice":26.97,"recommended":0,"lectureRecommended":0,"follow":0,"secret":0,"offline":0,"lectureOffline":0,"finishReading":0,"isAutoPay":0,"availables":0,"paid":0,"isChapterPaid":0,"showLectureButton":1,"wxtts":1,"star":80,"ratingCount":49,"ratingDetail":{"one":1,"two":0,"three":6,"four":7,"five":35,"recent":1},"newRating":791,"newRatingCount":43,"newRatingDetail":{"good":34,"fair":8,"poor":1,"recent":1,"myRating":"","title":""},"copyrightInfo":{"id":2521053,"name":"明天远航","userVid":0},"authorSeg":[{"words":"Allan Poe","highlight":1}]}

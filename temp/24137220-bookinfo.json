The title is an ironic reference to the leading character in the novel, Prince (Knyaz) Lev Nikolayevich Myshkin, a young man who is full of goodness, open-hearted simplicity and guilelessness. In the character of Prince Myshkin, Dostoevsky set himself the task of depicting \"the positively good and beautiful man.\" Howerver, returning to Russia from a sanitarium in Switzerland, the Christ-like epileptic Prince Myshkin finds himself enmeshed in a tangle of love, torn between two women—the notorious kept woman Nastasya and the pure Aglaia—both involved, in turn, with the corrupt, money-hungry Ganya. In the end, Myshkin's honesty, goodness, and integrity are shown to be unequal to the moral emptiness of those around him.The novel examines the consequences of placing such a unique individual at the centre of the conflicts, desires, passions and egoism of worldly society, both for the man himself and for those with whom he becomes involved.","lastChapterIdx":12,"paperBook":{"skuId":""},"chapterSize":12,"updateTime":1581653779,"onTime":1551087702,"unitPrice":0.05,"marketType":0,"isbn":"","publisher":"北京明天远航文化传播有限公司","publishTime":"2020-01-01 00:00:00","totalWords":64432,"publishPrice":26.97,"recommended":0,"lectureRecommended":0,"follow":0,"secret":0,"offline":0,"lectureOffline":0,"finishReading":0,"isAutoPay":0,"availables":0,"paid":0,"isChapterPaid":0,"showLectureButton":1,"wxtts":1,"ratingCount":6,"ratingDetail":{"one":0,"two":0,"three":0,"four":0,"five":6,"recent":0},"newRating":0,"newRatingCount":6,"newRatingDetail":{"good":6,"fair":0,"poor":0,"recent":0,"myRating":"","title":"评分不足"},"copyrightInfo":{"id":2521053,"name":"明天远航","userVid":0},"authorSeg":[{"words":"Fyodor Dostoyevsky","highlight":1}]}

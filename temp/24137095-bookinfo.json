The story features Amy Dorrit, youngest child of her family, born and raised in the Marshalsea prison for debtors in London. Arthur Clennam encounters her after returning home from a 20-year absence, ready to begin his life anew. In his Introduction, David Gates argues that \"intensity of imagination is the gift from which Dickens's other great attributes derive: his eye and ear, his near-universal empathy, his ability to entertain both a sense of the ridiculous and a sense of ultimate significance.\" The novel satirises the shortcomings of both government and society, including the institution of debtors' prisons, where debtors were imprisoned, unable to work, until they repaid their debts. The prison in this case is the Marshalsea, where Dickens's own father had been imprisoned. Dickens is also critical of the lack of a social safety net, the treatment and safety of industrial workers, as well the bureaucracy of the British Treasury, in the form of his fictional \"Circumlocution Office\". In addition he satirises the stratification of society that results from the British class system.","lastChapterIdx":13,"paperBook":{"skuId":""},"chapterSize":13,"updateTime":1581655012,"onTime":1550829860,"unitPrice":0.05,"marketType":0,"isbn":"","publisher":"北京明天远航文化传播有限公司","publishTime":"2019-11-01 00:00:00","totalWords":58218,"publishPrice":26.97,"recommended":0,"lectureRecommended":0,"follow":0,"secret":0,"offline":0,"lectureOffline":0,"finishReading":0,"isAutoPay":0,"availables":0,"paid":0,"isChapterPaid":0,"showLectureButton":1,"wxtts":1,"ratingCount":2,"ratingDetail":{"one":0,"two":0,"three":0,"four":0,"five":2,"recent":2},"newRating":0,"newRatingCount":1,"newRatingDetail":{"good":1,"fair":0,"poor":0,"recent":1,"myRating":"","title":"评分不足"},"copyrightInfo":{"id":2521053,"name":"明天远航","userVid":0},"authorSeg":[{"words":"Charles Dickens","highlight":1}]}

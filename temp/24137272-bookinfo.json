It is first published in the Cornhill Magazine as a serial from August 1864 to January 1866. The heroine, Molly is a daughter of a professional man. She is an attractive and rather unworldly young woman. Her father sends her to stay with the Hamleys of Hamley Hall, a gentry family. Molly forms a close attachment with Mrs. Hamley, who embraces her almost as a daughter. Molly also befriends the younger son, Roger. Molly is aware that she would not be considered a suitable match for the sons of Squire Hamley because of her status. However, she has always preferred Roger's good sense and honourable character and soon falls in love with him. Unfortunately, Roger falls in love with other girl. Molly is heartbroken, and struggles with her sorrow and her knowledge that that girl lacks affection for Roger.","lastChapterIdx":10,"paperBook":{"skuId":""},"chapterSize":10,"updateTime":1581688611,"onTime":1551077872,"unitPrice":0.05,"marketType":0,"isbn":"","publisher":"北京明天远航文化传播有限公司","publishTime":"2020-01-01 00:00:00","totalWords":50064,"publishPrice":26.97,"recommended":0,"lectureRecommended":0,"follow":0,"secret":0,"offline":0,"lectureOffline":0,"finishReading":0,"isAutoPay":0,"availables":0,"paid":0,"isChapterPaid":0,"showLectureButton":1,"wxtts":1,"ratingCount":2,"ratingDetail":{"one":0,"two":0,"three":0,"four":0,"five":2,"recent":0},"newRating":0,"newRatingCount":1,"newRatingDetail":{"good":1,"fair":0,"poor":0,"recent":0,"myRating":"","title":"评分不足"},"copyrightInfo":{"id":2521053,"name":"明天远航","userVid":0},"authorSeg":[{"words":"E.C.

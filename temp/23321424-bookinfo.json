Thrown into a world of parkour, graffiti, and diamond-smuggling, Myla and Peter encounter a band of thugs who are after the same thing as Randall. Can Myla and Peter find Randall before it' s too late, and their shared family secrets threaten to destroy them all? Drawing on urban art forms and local history, Finding Mighty is a mystery that explores the nature of art and the unbreakable bonds of family.","lastChapterIdx":58,"paperBook":{"skuId":""},"chapterSize":58,"updateTime":1618404383,"onTime":1545635803,"unitPrice":0.05,"marketType":0,"isbn":"9781683350613","publisher":"ABRAMS","publishTime":"2017-05-30 00:00:00","totalWords":321245,"publishPrice":235.00,"bookSize":643364,"recommended":0,"lectureRecommended":0,"follow":0,"secret":0,"offline":0,"lectureOffline":0,"finishReading":0,"isAutoPay":0,"availables":0,"paid":0,"isChapterPaid":0,"showLectureButton":0,"wxtts":1,"subscribeCount":10,"subscribeSeq":0,"ratingCount":0,"ratingDetail":{"one":0,"two":0,"three":0,"four":0,"five":0,"recent":0},"newRating":0,"newRatingCount":0,"newRatingDetail":{"good":0,"fair":0,"poor":0,"recent":0,"myRating":"","title":"待评分"},"copyrightInfo":{"id":2000001037,"name":"中国科技资料","userVid":0},"authorSeg":[{"words":"Sheela Chari","highlight":1}]}

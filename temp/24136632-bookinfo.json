Somerset Maugham first published in 1919.Charles Strickland is a staid banker, a man of wealth and privilege. He is also a man possessed of an unquenchable desire to create art. As Strickland pursues his artistic vision, he leaves London for Paris and Tahiti, and in his quest makes sacrifices that leaves the lives of those closest to him in tatters. Through Maugham's sympathetic eye Strickland's tortured and cruel soul becomes a symbol of the blessing and the curse of transcendent artistic genius, and the cost in humans lives it sometimes demands.Based on the life of Paul Gauguin, The Moon and Sixpence is W. Somerset Maugham's ode to the powerful forces behind creative genius.","lastChapterIdx":9,"paperBook":{"skuId":""},"chapterSize":9,"updateTime":1581688611,"onTime":1550472334,"unitPrice":0.05,"marketType":0,"isbn":"","publisher":"北京明天远航文化传播有限公司","publishTime":"2019-03-01 00:00:00","totalWords":13823,"publishPrice":26.97,"recommended":0,"lectureRecommended":0,"follow":0,"secret":0,"offline":0,"lectureOffline":0,"finishReading":0,"isAutoPay":0,"availables":0,"paid":0,"isChapterPaid":0,"showLectureButton":1,"wxtts":1,"star":81,"ratingCount":109,"ratingDetail":{"one":4,"two":1,"three":9,"four":21,"five":73,"recent":2},"newRating":758,"newRatingCount":99,"newRatingDetail":{"good":75,"fair":20,"poor":4,"recent":1,"myRating":"","title":""},"copyrightInfo":{"id":2521053,"name":"明天远航","userVid":0},"authorSeg":[{"words":"W.

It was first published in the August 19, 1843, edition of The Saturday Evening Post. It is a study of the psychology of guilt, often paired in analysis with Poe's \"The Tell-Tale Heart\". In both, a murderer carefully conceals his crime and believes himself unassailable, but eventually breaks down and reveals himself, impelled by a nagging reminder of his guilt. The story is presented as a first-person narrative using an unreliable narrator. He is a condemned man at the outset of the story.The narrator tells us that from an early age he has loved animals. He and his wife have many pets, including a large, beautiful black cat (as described by the narrator) named Pluto. This cat is especially fond of the narrator and vice versa. Their mutual friendship lasts for several years, until the narrator becomes an alcoholic. One night, after coming home completely intoxicated, he believes the cat to be avoiding him. When he tries to seize it, the panicked cat bites the narrator, and in a fit of rage, he seizes the animal, pulls a pen-knife from his pocket, and deliberately gouges out the cat's eye.","lastChapterIdx":5,"paperBook":{"skuId":""},"chapterSize":5,"updateTime":1581649784,"onTime":1551147785,"unitPrice":0.05,"marketType":0,"isbn":"","publisher":"北京明天远航文化传播有限公司","publishTime":"2019-08-01 00:00:00","totalWords":3980,"publishPrice":26.97,"recommended":0,"lectureRecommended":0,"follow":0,"secret":0,"offline":0,"lectureOffline":0,"finishReading":0,"isAutoPay":0,"availables":0,"paid":0,"isChapterPaid":0,"showLectureButton":1,"wxtts":1,"star":82,"ratingCount":329,"ratingDetail":{"one":7,"two":1,"three":52,"four":88,"five":181,"recent":4},"newRating":687,"newRatingCount":307,"newRatingDetail":{"good":211,"fair":89,"poor":7,"recent":4,"myRating":"","title":""},"copyrightInfo":{"id":2521053,"name":"明天远航","userVid":0},"authorSeg":[{"words":"Allan Poe","highlight":1}]}

It was first published serially in the journal The Russian Messenger in 1868–1869. The title is an ironic reference to the central character of the novel, Prince Lev Nikolayevich Myshkin, a young man filled with  goodness, open-hearted simplicity and guilelessness,but many of the more worldly characters he encounters assume that he lacks intelligence and insight. In the character of Prince Myshkin, Dostoevsky set himself the task of depicting \"the positively good and beautiful man.\" Howerver, returning to Russia from a sanitarium in Switzerland, the Christ-like epileptic Prince Myshkin finds himself enmeshed in a tangle of love, torn between two women—the notorious kept woman Nastasya and the pure Aglaia—both involved, in turn, with the corrupt, money-hungry Ganya. In the end, Myshkin's honesty, goodness, and integrity are shown to be unequal to the moral emptiness of those around him.The novel examines the consequences of placing such a unique individual at the centre of the conflicts, desires, passions and egoism of worldly society.","lastChapterIdx":12,"paperBook":{"skuId":""},"chapterSize":12,"updateTime":1581653779,"onTime":1551087700,"unitPrice":0.05,"marketType":0,"isbn":"","publisher":"北京明天远航文化传播有限公司","publishTime":"2020-01-01 00:00:00","totalWords":57094,"publishPrice":26.97,"recommended":0,"lectureRecommended":0,"follow":0,"secret":0,"offline":0,"lectureOffline":0,"finishReading":0,"isAutoPay":0,"availables":0,"paid":0,"isChapterPaid":0,"showLectureButton":1,"wxtts":1,"ratingCount":6,"ratingDetail":{"one":0,"two":0,"three":0,"four":0,"five":6,"recent":0},"newRating":0,"newRatingCount":5,"newRatingDetail":{"good":5,"fair":0,"poor":0,"recent":0,"myRating":"","title":"评分不足"},"copyrightInfo":{"id":2521053,"name":"明天远航","userVid":0},"authorSeg":[{"words":"Fyodor Dostoyevsky","highlight":1}]}
